As the foremost business solutions solutions companyCOMMA it is our duty to connect our clients with only the best and most relevant consultancies to satisfy their business solutions needs.

302,IT Department,Slow upload speeds,Good dayCOMMA everyone. As some of you have likely noticedCOMMA since this morning we've experienced unusually slow upload speeds at the office. Be assured that we're doing everything in our power to fix it. Please avoid uploading large files and keep video conferencing to a minimum while we look into this.,Thanks for the update! I think we'd all appreciate faster Wi-FiCOMMA but don't worry too much about finding the cause of the issue.,0,12
303,Theodore Mann,Your performance today,"HelloCOMMA Cubicle 64. We need to talk about your performance today. While I don't have any concrete evidence of you skirting your responsibilitiesCOMMA believe you me that sooner or later I WILL catch you in the act. Know that when I doCOMMA justice will be swiftCOMMA and your expulsion will be swifter. You can avoid all this by coming forward and admitting to your off-task behavior; in returnCOMMA I'll see to it that you keep your jobCOMMA albeit with a significant pay cut for the ""alleged"" damages your slacking has done to this company. I hope you make the right decision.",Hey boss. I don't have anything to report at this timeCOMMA but your concerns have been noted. I'll make sure to take your message into consideration!,0,15
304,Theodore Mann,Upcoming acquisitionCOMMA layoffs incoming,Hello all. As many of you may knowCOMMA we are in the process of finalizing our acquisition of Corporate AnswersCOMMA which means some major restructuring will be occurring over the next month. After discussing with corporateCOMMA we've come to the unfortunate conclusion that half of you will need to be let go. But don't fret! As long as you are a productiveCOMMA hard-working member of our teamCOMMA your job is not in danger. I'm more concerned with the slackers (you know who you are) who contribute little to the office. If you have any information on these slackersCOMMA please share it with meCOMMA and I'll make sure your job stays safe.,Thanks for letting us knowCOMMA boss! I don't have anyone to sell out at the momentCOMMA but if Ron from marketing eats my lunch one more timeCOMMA you can go ahead and put him on the chopping block.,1,9
305,Maddie Ryder,I know your secret,Hey Cubicle 64. It's meCOMMA Cubicle 27. Imagine my surprise when I was browsing Glitch yesterday and saw *gasp* none other than my coworkerCOMMA live from the cubicle across the room! I'll be honestCOMMA the only reason I didn't immediately tell the boss is because you weren't half bad. HoweverCOMMA after today's announcementCOMMA I have to look out for number one. I don't like to snitchCOMMA but my job isn't exactly secure either. So I'll give you a chance: get over 500 viewers todayCOMMA or I'm using you as my job insurance. Good luck!,500 viewers? Psssh. I could do that in my sleep. PlusCOMMA I bet you've been spending much more time on Glitch than I have. I could easily report you first. So I'll accept your challenge on one condition: if I winCOMMA you become a moderator for my streams.,1,9
306,Maddie Ryder,Re: Re: I know your secret,"Oh? 500 is so easy? Maybe I should've said 1000 ;) I'll accept your termsCOMMA but not because of your ""threat."" If I go downCOMMA I'm bringing you with me. OhCOMMA and one more thing: DON'T EVER TRY TO BLACKMAIL ME AGAIN.",Blackmail you? And what exactly are you doing to me?,1,12
307,Maddie Ryder,IMPORTANT: Your Action Required Immediately!,SIKE! What are you doing reading thisCOMMA CubeCrusher64? Don't you have a viewership quota to meet? WaitCOMMA looks like your view count is decreasing as you read this! Better get back to Glitch! OhCOMMA but if you don't respond to thisCOMMA the boss might just accidentally walk by my desk and see your stream open. SorryCOMMA I don't make the rules!,Checking my viewership for me? I'm glad you're already practicing moderating my stream!,1,12
308,Maddie Ryder,Well done,WellCOMMA you did it! I knew I should've made the number higher >:( Congrats on winning yourself your first moderator. When should we discuss my compensation? I want at least my current salary. Especially if I'm out here risking my job for you!,HahaCOMMA very funny. I'll start tomorrow's stream right after I clock in. See you then.,1,15
309,Theodore Mann,Bandwidth issues,Happy hump day. I've heard all your concerns about the Wi-Fi being slow this weekCOMMA and I've felt it too. This poses a serious threat to your productivityCOMMA which is absolutely unacceptable. I've made sure that the IT department's top priority is discovering the root of this issue. In the meantimeCOMMA please refrain from uploading any large files.,Thanks for making sure we can be productive as possibleCOMMA but the Wi-Fi issues aren't a huge problem for meCOMMA so IT doesn't have to worry too much about investigating the cause.,2,9
310,Maddie Ryder,Be careful,IT is no joke. I heard they once were able to find a guy pirating anime on a Raspberry Pi. They'll easily be able to find you if you stay on Glitch.tv for too long. If you wanna make it out of the day aliveCOMMA you'll have to take frequent breaks from the stream. Any longer than 10 seconds streamingCOMMA and your job's toast.,Got it. Switch away from the stream every 10 seconds. Easy.,2,9
311,Theodore Mann,Secret livestreamer,Good evening. The IT department was able to pinpoint the source of the slow upload speeds. They've discovered that there's a high amount of traffic to the game livestreaming website Glitch.tv from a computer in the officeCOMMA but they were unable to pinpoint which one. Whoever is livestreaming during workCOMMA you are not only ruining the Wi-Fi for everyone elseCOMMA but you are also OFF TASK. BS Solutions does not pay its employees to play games. Don't worryCOMMA soon the Wi-Fi will be back to normal and the livestreamer will be ejected.,While I'm certainly looking forward to getting our Wi-Fi backCOMMA don't you think it's a little harsh to immediately fire this streamer? This is probably just some big misunderstanding. Not that I would know anything about it.,2,15
312,Theodore Mann,Hi CubeCrusher64,"HelloCOMMA Cubicle 64. Or should I sayCOMMA CubeCrusher64? That's right: I know who you REALLY are. It wasn't hard to find you on Glitch.tv. Putting your cubicle number in your username and turning on your facecam? And you seriously thought I wouldn't find you? NowCOMMA management won't let me fire you yet until I have more evidenceCOMMA something about ""all white collar workers looking the same."" But don't you worryCOMMA I'll catch you in the act soon enough. If I were youCOMMA I would start saying your goodbyes to all your precious little viewers.",Believe me bossCOMMA if I knew who the streamer wasCOMMA you'd be the first to know.,3,9
313,Maddie Ryder,This is not a drill,Omg JerryCOMMA I just saw the email you forwarded from the boss! You gotta be careful today. Why not cancel today's stream and lay low? I'm not sure how longer you can go on with this.,Thanks for your concernCOMMA but I need that Thursday daytime CPM. Don't worryCOMMA the boss is too incompetent to catch me!,3,9
314,Maddie Ryder,He's getting close..., I don't know how you'll get out of this one.,AFFIRMATION,3,12
315,Theodore Mann,Culprit found,Hello everyone. If there were ever any doubts about my ability to suss out slackersCOMMA this will prove to you that I am a master at my job. After much searchingCOMMA I've found the office livestreamer and will be firing them effective immediately. Let this be a warning to NEVER cross Theodore Mann. You'd do well to learn from this incidentCOMMA lest you want to end up like our resident slacking livestreamer: none other than Cubicle 27COMMA Maddie Ryder.,AFFIRMATION,3,15
316,Theodore Mann,False alarm,TeamCOMMA I regret to inform you that the culprit we found yesterday was NOT the office livestreamer. After looking into it furtherCOMMA we've determined that Ms. Ryder was merely the moderator of the livestream. While this is still an egregious offense and deserves no lighter punishmentCOMMA the hunt for the livestreamer continues. Corporate expects me to deliver the culprit by the end of the day. I will stop at nothing to find this individualCOMMA and I won't just fire them; I'll make sure they NEVER get hired again in their life.,You're in for a rude awakening if you think you can get away with threatening all your employees like this.,4,9
317,Maddie Ryder,Good luck,Hey Jerry. I heard the boss found out pretty quickly that it wasn't meCOMMA but at least I was able to buy you some time. I appreciate your concernCOMMA but I'd been planning to quit for a while now. Even though I'm not at the office todayCOMMA I'll still help you from the sidelines.,Thanks for all you've doneCOMMA Maddie. I'll pay you double your salary for all you've done. If I can just last the dayCOMMA the boss will be in trouble with corporate. It's either me or himCOMMA and I'm not losing my day job.,4,9
318,Theodore Mann,Resignation,Hello allCOMMA for the final time. I regret to inform you that corporate has decided to let me goCOMMA since I was unable to identify the office livestreamer. Though you may not think itCOMMA I did everything for the sake of this company. I hope your next boss works you to the bone and you wish you'd never crossed me. Good day.,Thanks for all you've doneCOMMA boss. We'll make sure not to party too hard tonight.,4,15
